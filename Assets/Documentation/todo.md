Core Physics Foundation:

1. Tire grip physics - The foundation for everything else (traction system)
2. Slip angle calculation - Determines when drifting happens
3. Angular velocity/yaw control - Makes the car rotate and drift

Drifting Mechanics:

4. Drift detection & response - Enables the drift state and applies drift forces
5. Weight transfer - Makes the car feel realistic during transitions

Polish & Tuning:
6. Brake bias - Fine-tune stopping and power-sliding
7. Suspension/damping - Body roll and weight simulation
8. Drag & downforce - Speed-dependent physics
9. Tuning parameter system - Easy configuration
10. Drift scoring - Gameplay reward system
