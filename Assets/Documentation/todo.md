I've created a comprehensive todo list for building a drifting game with custom physics! Here's the priority order:

Core Physics Foundation:

Tire grip physics - The foundation for everything else (traction system)
Slip angle calculation - Determines when drifting happens
Angular velocity/yaw control - Makes the car rotate and drift
Drifting Mechanics:
4. Drift detection & response - Enables the drift state and applies drift forces
5. Weight transfer - Makes the car feel realistic during transitions

Polish & Tuning:
6. Brake bias - Fine-tune stopping and power-sliding
7. Suspension/damping - Body roll and weight simulation
8. Drag & downforce - Speed-dependent physics
9. Tuning parameter system - Easy configuration
10. Drift scoring - Gameplay reward system

Which physics system would you like to tackle first? I'd recommend starting with tire grip physics since it's the foundation for slip angle and drifting.
